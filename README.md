## Task 8.1: Google Cloud Vision

In order to harness the benefits of Google Cloud Platform for Computer Vision we need to set up the initial environment which includes enabling the Cloud Vision API, create a bucket accessible for all users and, finally, create the credentials to connect directly from Python. The advantages of these machine learning APIs is that offers powerful and simple tools to perform complex anallytical tasks.

1) Enable Cloud Vision API: You can go to API & Services in the left panel and select library. Then type the name of the API and enable it in your project.
